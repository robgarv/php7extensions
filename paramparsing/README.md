# Parameter Parsing

## dumpstring

This example uses "traditional" parameter parsing APIs to parse parameters
and perform basic array access. The extensions is written in C++, just
to show how that can be done. The GDB_BLOCK macro is used to block
execution of the extension to facilitate attaching a debugger.
