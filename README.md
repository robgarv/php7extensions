# php7extensions
A repo containing examples of PHP 7.x extensions in C and C++

This repo will contain small, sample projects to demonstrate how to implement features in PHP 7.x extensions.

Of course, I'm writing these things because a) I need to learn this stuff and b) there seems to be a shortage of clear and complete documentation on the web. I'm putting these up on github so I will always have a "cheat sheet" available. And who knows ... maybe the results of my fumbling efforts will help out some other developer some day.
